The configuration file
The myproxy proxy can be configured with the file called server.properties.
Following entries are supported (so far):

server.http-proxy (true—false) Set this to true to use a remote HTTP proxy
server. Default: false

server.http-proxy.hostname The hostname of the remote proxy (or IP-address)

server.http-proxy.port (integer number) The port number of the remote
HTTP proxy

server.filter.http (true—false) If set to true, the Referer header will be
removed and the User-Agent header will be changed to a new value.
WARNING: Set only to true if you know what Referer and User-Agent
mean. Some of your websites may become unusable.

server.filter.http.useragent (Browser identification like ”Mozilla/4.0 ....”) If
server.filter.http is set to true, this field overwrites the ”User-Agent”
HTTP Header (contains information about the browser)

server.enable-cookies-by-default (true—false) This boolean value controls
the default handling for cookies. If set to false, all cookies will be removed,
if the spezific domain is not catched by a search pattern in the url manager.
If set to true, all cookies will be untouched, if no other setting in the URL-
Filter is given.

server.debug-logging (true—false) Enables the low-level logging, probably
only useful for developer

server.port (Integer number) server.port is a number from 0 to 65535; some
port numbers (especially below 1024) are reserved for particular protocols.
The default value is 8088, but you can change this, if nesessary. This
happens when the default port is already being used by another application
in the system. Server port changes take effect on restart.
